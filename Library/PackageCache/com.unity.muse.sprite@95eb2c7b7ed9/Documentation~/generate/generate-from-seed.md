# Generate from a seed

Every sprite you generate comes with a seed. A seed is a number that either you enter or the tool generates automatically.

## Specify a custom seed

To specify a custom seed when you generate a sprite from [a prompt](xref:get-started), [a scribble](xref:generate-from-scribble), or [a reference image](xref:generate-from-reference), in the **Style and Parameters** section, enable **Custom Seed** and enter a seed number.

## Generate the same sprite

The seed combined with the prompts is used to identify the sprite. To generate the same sprite, use the same seed and prompt. For example:

- A seed of `10` with the prompt of `dog` generates the same dog sprite.
- A seed of `10` with the prompt of `cat` generates the same cat sprite.

To find and copy the seed number and prompts of an existing sprite, in the **Generations** panel, right-click the sprite and select **Generation Settings**.
