# Write a prompt

The **Muse Sprite Generator** tool generates sprites. A sprite is a 2D image that you can use as a 2D element in a game, such as a dog or a tree in your game.

To generate sprites, you write a prompt that describes the sprite you want to generate. Consider the tips and best practices described on this page when you write the prompt.

## Use keywords rather than sentences

To describe the sprite you want to generate, use keywords instead of sentences. For example, use `dog` instead of `generate a dog sprite`.

To ensure the separation of concepts, enter multiple keywords separated by commas.
## Start simple and refine

Begin with a relatively simple prompt, like an object. You can then add some adjectives to explore different aspects of the generation. Here are a few ideas to initiate your process:

- A dog
- A cute dog
- A cute blue dog

To add more to the results, try refinement.

## Include "full body" to generate full animals

To generate the full animal instead of just the head, include `full body` in the prompt.

## Exclude elements from the generated sprites

To exclude specific elements from generated sprites, in the **Negative Prompt**, enter keywords that describe the elements to exclude. To ensure the separation of concepts, enter multiple keywords separated by commas.
