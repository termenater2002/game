# Generate from a reference image

You can generate sprites from a reference image. A reference image can be an image in your Project window, in the **Scene** view, or in your own generated images.

> [!TIP]
> To create game-specific art, consider training your own models on your own art.

1. Do any of the following to get a reference image:

    - Use the **Sprite Picker** in the **Input Image** panel to pick.
    - Drag the image to the **Input Image** panel.
    - Right-click the image in the **Project** window and select **Open in Muse**.
1. In the **Prompt** field, write a prompt that describes the sprite you want to generate.
1. To set the number of images to generate, move the **Images** slider.
1. If you don't want a background in the generated sprites, enable **Remove Background**.
1. To set the style strength, move the **Style Strength** slider. Higher values result in more closely aligned styles.
1. To set the likeness between the generated sprites and the reference image, move the **Tightness** slider. Higher values result in more alike sprites.
1. Select **Generate**. The generated sprites appear in the **Generations** panel.
