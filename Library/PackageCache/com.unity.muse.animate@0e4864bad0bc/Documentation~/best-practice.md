# Best practices for using Muse Animate

Here are some best practices to help you get the most out of Muse Animate.

* **Use the Key Settings section**: Use the tools in the **Key Settings** section to refine your animation. For example, **Transition Duration**, **Extrapolated pose**, and **Loop to first pose**. 

* **Optimize keyframes**: Don't overload your playback controls with unnecessary keyframes. Add keyframes only where significant changes occur. This makes your animation easier to manage and results in a smoother motion.

* **Pay attention to time and space**: Proper timing makes your animation look more natural and realistic, while careful spacing ensures smooth and natural movements. Use the playback controls to adjust the space between keyframes and refine the timing of your animation.
