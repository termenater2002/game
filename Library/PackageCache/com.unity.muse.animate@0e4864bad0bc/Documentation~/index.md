# About Muse Animate

The Muse Animate is a tool that uses machine learning (ML) to generate natural-looking character [animation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationSection.html) based on the text prompt you enter.

## Muse Animate key features

Use the following features of Muse Animate to streamline your animation process:

* **AI-generated motion between pose keyframes**: Muse Animate generates smooth and lifelike transitions between keyframes. After you define several pose keyframes, Muse Animate fills in the gaps and creates seamless motion without extensive manual adjustments. The tool is effective with a minimal number of keyframes, simplifying the animation workflow.
* **In-Editor integration**: Muse Animate integrates directly into the Unity Editor to provide an accessible animation creation experience. This allows for the direct creation of [Unity animation clips](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationClips.html) within the editor. 
* **Text-to-motion**: Muse Animate converts textual descriptions directly into animated sequences using natural language processing algorithms.
* **Compatibility with Unity humanoid rig**: Muse Animate applies the generated animations to any character that utilizes the [Unity humanoid rig](xref:UsingHumanoidChars). This provides broad compatibility across different projects.
