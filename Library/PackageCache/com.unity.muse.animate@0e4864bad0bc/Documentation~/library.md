# Manage Library

The **Library** section organizes and manages your animations. You can browse the **Library** section to view a list of your saved animations. You can also use the search bar to find specific animations.

Use the **Everything** dropdown to find and manage different types of animations. The available options are:

* **Everything**: Default view that displays all the animations in your **Library**. Select this option to view all animations, including generations, edited generations, and saved animations.

* **Generations**: Displays only the **Generated Take** animations. Select this option to view animations created using the text prompt in the **Muse Animate Generator**.

* **Edited generations**: Displays only the **Editable Take** animations. Select this option to view animations that you generated using the text prompt and have modified.

## View animation

By default, the **Library** section displays the [**Generated Take**](#generated-take-animations) animations. Hover over an animation to preview it. Double-click an animation to open it in the center pane of the **Muse Animate Generator** window.

You can further inspect or convert your animation into frames. To return to the **Library**, select **Library** at the top-left corner of the **Muse Animate Generator** window.

## Manage animation

In the **Library** section, hover over the animation you want to manage to display the following options:

* **Convert to frames** icon: Opens the **Generated Take** animation in the **Muse Animate Generator**'s editor where you can break it into separate frames.

* Contextual menu icon: Shows the following additional options:
   * **Use This Prompt**: Loads the selected prompt into the **Generations** section.
   * **Export**: Opens a dialog window, where you can specify a file name and select a destination folder. If you export an animation, you can use it in other projects or share it with collaborators.
   * **Duplicate**: Creates a copy of the selected animation. You can duplicate an animation when you want to modify it without changing the original version.
   * **Delete**: Permanently removes the selected animation from the **Library**.

## Library icons

In Muse Animate, animations in the **Library** fall in two categories based on their status: **Generated Take** or **Editable Take**. 

### Generated Take animations

Muse Animate creates these animations based on your prompts. They're the initial output that you can review and assess before deciding whether to convert them into **Editable Take** for further refinement.

To identify a **Generated Take** animation, move your cursor over the animation in the **Library**. When you do this, a tooltip appears that displays the status of the animation. For example, `Generated Take 1 high jump`.

### Editable Take animations

**Editable Take** animations are the ones that you have modified and refined. These animations are converted from **Generated Take** animations. Muse Animate distinguishes them with a concentric circles icon displayed over the animation's thumbnail in the **Library**.
