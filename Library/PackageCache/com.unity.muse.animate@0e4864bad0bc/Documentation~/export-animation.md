# Export animation

Export your animation to use it in your project, share it, or publish it.

The location of the **Export** control varies based on the animation type.

* **Editable Take**: Locate the **Export** option in the contextual menu (**...**) in the **Library** and in the toolbar on the Viewport.

* **Generated Take**: Locate the **Export** option in the contextual menu (**...**) in the **Library**.

When your animation is complete and ready for export, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Export** icon from the toolbar. 
2. Muse Animate saves the animation in the project's `Assets` folder, by default. You can create a subfolder within the `Assets` folder and select that subfolder.

    You can't save the animation file in a different location. This approach ensures that you save all media and resources together in the `Assets` folder.
3. Select **Save**.

## Move animations to Unity Editor

After you edit and save your animation, you can transfer it and use it in your Unity projects. 

To transfer your animation, follow these steps:

1. Launch the Unity Editor, and open the project where you want to import the animation.
2. Navigate to the Muse Animate **Library** where you saved your animations. 
3. Use the **Everything** dropdown to locate your specific animation.
4. Drag the animation from the **Library** into the Unity Editor. 

   Muse Animate converts the animation into a `.anim` file format and saves it in the **Assets** folder of your Unity project.
