# Generate animation

Use the **Generation** section in Muse Animate to create new animations, define the characteristics of your animation, and start the generation process.

1. Open Muse Animate from Unity Editor's menu. For more information, refer to [Launch Muse Animate](install-animate.md#launch-muse-animate).

   The **Muse Animate Generator** window opens.

2. In the text field, use natural language to describe a motion you want Muse Animate to generate. For example, `walk forward` or `wave hand`.
3. In **Generations**, enter the number of variations for this animation that you want Muse Animate to generate.

   Valid values include numbers in the range of `1` - `4`. For example, if you enter `3` in **Generations**, Muse Animate creates three different versions of the animation based on the input parameter.
4. In **Duration (sec)**, enter a float value that represents the length of the animation, in seconds. The maximum duration you can set for an animation is 5.0 seconds.

   For example, to create a 4-second animation, enter `4`.
5. Select **Generate**.

   Muse Animate generates the specified number of animation variations and displays them in the **Library** section. Each animation is slightly different from the others. For more information on how to manage animations, refer to [Manage Library](library.md).
6. Select the generated animations to view them.

## Manage Generations pane

You can collapse and expand the **Generations** pane.  To collapse it, select the cross (**X**) button. This action collapses the pane from view and maximizes the workspace for other tasks. To reopen the **Generations** pane, select the double arrow (**>>**) button near the edge of the center pane. This action restores the **Generations** panel.

Use the slider near the bottom of the **Library** pane to adjust the size of animation thumbnails.
