# Use Muse Chat web

This section provides information on how to use and interact with the web version of Unity's Muse Chat.

1. Log in to Muse Chat. Refer to [Log in to Muse Chat](web-chat.md#log-in-to-muse-chat).

   Once logged in, active subscribers have access to the Muse Chat web interface.
3. To begin a new conversation, select **New Chat**.
4. Click inside the text field at the bottom of the chat window.
5. Enter your query or prompt into the text field.
6. (Optional) Select a Unity version number from the **Version** dropdown menu if you want to receive a response for a specific Unity version.

   If you want to receive a response for a specific version of Unity, it's advised to select a version from the **Version** dropdown menu. This is because API changes between Unity versions can affect the availability and behavior of packages and features. If you select a specific version, Muse Chat provides information that's accurate and relevant to that version of Unity.

   In contrast, Muse Chat Editor is integrated directly within the Unity Editor. It accesses the Unity environment and project settings. This integration enables Muse Chat Editor to automatically detect the Unity version number you're using. For more information, refer to [Muse Chat Editor](editor-chat.md).

7. Press **Enter** on your keyboard or select the send icon to submit your query.

   Muse Chat processes your input and displays a response in the chat window.
8. Read the response and, if needed, type follow-up questions in the text field.

## Use the History panel

To review previous interactions, use the **History** panel on the left of the Muse Chat window. Browse through your past queries and responses to find relevant information.

Muse Chat saves conversation history, allowing you to revisit past interactions at any time. To efficiently manage your workspace, you can hide or display the **History** panel.

1. Locate the **History** in the Muse Chat interface.
2. Select the arrow in the top-right corner of the **History** panel to hide the panel from view.
3. Select the history icon to expand and display the **History** panel.

### Delete a conversation

You can delete a conversation from the **History** panel. This action is permanent and can't be undone.

To delete a conversation from the **History** panel, perform the following steps:

1. Move your cursor over the conversation you want to delete from the list.
2. Select the **Delete** icon to open the secondary confirmation.
3. Select **Delete** to delete the conversation.

### Rename a conversation

Muse Chat allows you to rename a conversation so that you can identify its topic or purpose without opening or reviewing the chat history.

To rename a conversation from the **History** panel, perform the following steps:

1. Move your cursor over the conversation you want to rename from the list.
2. Select the **Rename** icon.
3. Enter the new name for the conversation.
4. Select **Save**.

## Access resources

If you need additional help or information, use the **Resources** panel on the right of the Muse Chat window. It provides links to user guides, tutorials, and other helpful documents.

## Additional features

Unity's Muse Chat provides several user interaction features to enhance your experience and ensure the responses are helpful.

2. Paste the copied text into your desired application (for example, a text editor, email, or document).

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you copy and paste code snippets or samples, Muse adds comments to indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) generated the code.

### Provide feedback

The feedback system allow you to provide positive or negative feedback on Muse Chat's response. It helps the development team understand which types of responses work well. Over time, it helps improve Muse Chat's performance by making the future responses more accurate and useful.
