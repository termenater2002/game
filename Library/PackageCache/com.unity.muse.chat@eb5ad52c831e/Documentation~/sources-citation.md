# Use Sources in Muse Chat Editor

When you ask a question in the Muse Chat Editor window, it provides a response that might include sentences with citation numbers (for example, `[1]`, `[2]`). These citations reference the information sources listed in the **Sources** section under the response.

To view a source, select **Sources** to expand and view the references or links. Select the source to open it in your default web browser.
